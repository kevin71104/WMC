Put all the *.m codes under the same directory, and run main.m to turn on the GUI interface. In our system, user may set numerous parameters as they wish by sliding slide bars or clicking on difference popups. After setting the parameters, click on the button “Render” for initialization, and click on “Run” to start the simulation. During simulation, user may observe MSs moving patterns, handover counts, and disconnection counts in realtime. Also, user may click on “Pause” or “Stop” to temporary pause the process or terminate the process.
